This Google Apps Script moves your low priority (promotional, social, political, etc.) emails in Gmail to a custom label and sends you a daily synopsis of received emails for review. Basically, this is `unroll.me` without any third-party access or [creepy data brokering](https://archive.is/30hj9).

## New Features & Improvements

- **Global Constants:**  
  Configure the script easily by setting global constants for your spreadsheet ID, sheet name, Gmail label, and email digest time range.
  
- **Performance Enhancements:**  
  The script now uses JavaScript Sets and batch updates (instead of multiple `appendRow` calls) to handle larger datasets more efficiently. My personal instance of this script filters messages from almost 1300 email addresses.
  
- **Automatic Deduplication:**  
  A new `dedupeEmails` function is included to automatically remove duplicate email addresses from your spreadsheet. You can schedule this to run periodically.
    
- **Improved Unsubscribe Link Extraction & HTML Template:**  
  The unsubscribe link extraction has been refined, and the HTML template now uses centralized CSS.
  
- **Modern Code Practices:**  
  The script has been updated with ES6 syntax (`const`, `let`, for‚Äëof loops) for improved clarity and maintainability.

## Configuration

1. **Create a Google Sheet:**  
   Create a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets. This spreadsheet will be used to keep track of low priority email addresses.

2. **Create a Gmail Label:**  
   Create a new Gmail label (e.g., `zbulk`).  
   If you use a different label, update the `ZBULK_LABEL` constant in the script accordingly.

3. **Set Up the Google Apps Script Project:**
   - Create a new Google Apps Script project.
   - Copy the updated code into the project's `Code.gs` file.
   - Replace the placeholder `SHEET_ID` (currently set to `'sheetID'`) with the actual ID of the spreadsheet (the string between `spreadsheets/d/` and `/edit` in your sheet's URL).
   - Update `SHEET_NAME` if your target sheet name differs from the default ("Sheet1").

4. **Configure the HTML Template:**
   - Include the updated HTML file named `email.html` in your project. This file controls the appearance of your daily digest.

5. **Set Up Triggers:**  
   Configure time-driven triggers for:
   - **`arch`:** Every 15 minutes (or as desired)  
     Archives, labels, and marks low priority emails as read.
   - **`addEmail`:** Daily (e.g., between midnight and 1am)  
     Batches and appends new email addresses to your spreadsheet.
   - **`noneroll`:** Daily (e.g., between 5 and 6am)  
     Sends a digest email summarizing emails from the past 24 hours.
   - **`dedupeEmails`:** Weekly (every Sunday, between 11pm and midnight)  
     Automatically deduplicates the email list in your spreadsheet.

## Usage & Maintenance

- **Tagging Emails:**  
  Tag any emails you wish to include in your low priority digest with your chosen Gmail label (e.g., `zbulk`).

- **Spreadsheet Data:**  
  Column A of your spreadsheet will be populated with the email addresses of low priority senders.  
  The script‚Äôs `addEmail` function should prevent duplicate entries, but the `dedupeEmails` function will periodically clean up any accidental duplicates.

- **Disabling Low Priority Flag:**  
  To stop an email from being flagged as low priority, remove its corresponding email address from your spreadsheet and (for safety) remove the label from any related messages in Gmail.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  The updated script handles thousands of entries efficiently. For extremely large datasets, consider archiving older data or scheduling deduplication more frequently.
